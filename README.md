Title: A Secure Two-Factor Authentication Scheme System

Abstract:

With the increasing prevalence of online services and the corresponding rise in cyber threats, the need for robust authentication mechanisms has become paramount. This paper presents a comprehensive study and the design of a secure two-factor authentication (2FA) scheme system aimed at enhancing the security of user accounts. The proposed system combines two distinct authentication factors - something the user knows (password) and something the user possesses (physical token or mobile device) - to create a multi-layered defense against unauthorized access.
